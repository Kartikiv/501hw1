## a) Program Execution and Testing

The stable matching program has been **implemented** and **executed successfully**. The algorithm was tested under various conditions, and it consistently returned a stable matching as expected. Five screenshots demonstrating successful tests of different scenarios are attached below.

## b) Instructions for Execution

### Prerequisites:
- The program is written in **Java**, so ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your machine. You can download the JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).

### Steps to Execute:
1. Download the source code of the program.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source file in your terminal.
3. Compile the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   javac StableMatchingAlgorithm.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java StableMatchingAlgorithm
   ```
5. The program will prompt you to enter the number of men (and women) participating in the matching process. Enter the desired number of participants and press enter.

6. The program will then randomly generate preference lists for men and women, execute the stable matching algorithm, and output the stable matching.

### Example:
```
Enter number of men (or women): 3
```
The program will output the matched pairs based on the generated preferences.

## c) Answers to Questions:

### i) Given the same instance, could there exist multiple stable matching?
Yes, multiple stable matching **could exist** for the same instance. This occurs because there may be different ways to pair the men and women based on their preferences without creating instability. However, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is designed to always produce a **man-optimal Or women-optimal** stable matching, meaning no man or women can get a better partner than in the matching generated by the algorithm.

### ii) Given the same instance, could different proposing orders of the men result in different stable matchings?
No, the different proposing orders of the men **do not result in different stable matching**. The Gale-Shapley algorithm guarantees the same stable matching regardless of the order in which men propose. This is because the algorithm always follows the preference lists of the men and women and prioritizes stable outcomes over the order of proposals.

In Our implementation, since the proposing men are chosen randomly, the order does not impact the final stable matching as long as the preference lists remain unchanged. The algorithm will always converge to the **same stable matching** for the same preference lists.
